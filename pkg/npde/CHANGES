Version 2.0 - September 2011

 o Bugfixes
   *

 o New features (see details in the PDF documentation and the online help files)
   * new methods to handle the data below the LOQ
   * prediction bands
   * covariate models
   * different methods for decorrelation (default method: Cholesky)

 o Reprogrammed using S4 classes; main changes include:
   * the structure of the output has changed: an object of class npdeObject is now created by a call to npde or autonpde
   * methods (special functions) plot, summary are now available and apply to the npdeObject object
       - all methods can be called simply as e.g. plot(x) where x is an object of class npdeObject (see documentation)
       - options for graphs and methods are stored in lists within the object and can be modified on the fly
   * new methods have been defined
       - the function testnpde() has been changed to the method npde()
   
 o Additional changes
   * the default option is now to compute the pd (calc.pd=TRUE)
   * the option "output=TRUE" has been removed; the npde and autonpde return a value which can be assigned to an object, but which remains invisible (not printed) when not assigned
   * a "method" option has been added to the call to autonpde; method="cholesky" uses the Cholesky decomposition to compute a square root of the individual variance-covariance matrix Vi; method="inverse" uses the inverse of Vi obtained through diagonalisation); method="polar" uses a combination of Cholesky decomposition and diagonalisation to obtain the same inverse (more stable)
   * a "continuous" option has been added; if TRUE, the distribution of pd is made continuous (default=XXX)
   * a "centering" option has been added; if TRUE, the distribution of pd is centered by substracting 1/(2K) so that pmin=1/(2K) and pmax=1-1/(2K); if FALSE, pmin=1/K and pmax=1, which was the default in the previous version of npde (default=XXX)


Version 1.2 - November 21st, 2007

 o Bugfixes
   * removed the warnings appearing at compilation with later versions of R (changes in the syntax of the man pages)
